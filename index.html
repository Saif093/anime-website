        <p>His spiritual power is noted to be heavy, which surprised Renji Abarai, a lieutenant-level Soul Reaper. Ichigo constantly gives off reiatsu at the level of a captain. Even when worn-out in battle, he can continue fighting effectively while still using Getsuga Tenshō or unleashing and maintaining his Bankai.</p>

Whether he's kicking through brick buildings or propelling himself into his opponents like a slingshot, you don't want to be on his bad side.</p>
